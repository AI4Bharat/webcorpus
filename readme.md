## Corpora

Corpora is a language-agnostic corpus crawler and processor specifically designed for Indian languages.


#### Setup

Clone the repository and run the following command:
```bash
pip3 install .
```

Note: Ensure that you're using `python3` and have JDK installed. (If not: `sudo apt install default-jdk`)

#### Usage

All the datasets generated by this tool are stored in the directory pointed by the `DATASTORE` environment variable. If not set, then the path is set to `~/datastore` by default.

* Re-compile the list of news sources:

  ```
  corpora fetch-sources
  ```

* Scrape news sources and build raw dataset:

  ```bash
  corpora fetch-news --lang <langcode> [--srange a,b]
  ```

* Process a raw dataset:

  ```bash
  corpora process-news --corpuspath <path> --lang <langcode>
  ```
* To run the crawler with pause/resume feature, edit the script `scripts/runcrawler.sh` appropriately and then execute:

  ```bash
  bash runcrawler.sh
  ```



#### Performance

* Crawls around 0.5 GB of raw data / day for 10 sources.
* To achieve better efficiency, run multiple instances of crawlers on different machines, each operating on a different set of sources.
* Need around 5GB of raw data for 100M tokens
