You'll receive eligible payments from your fundraiser 8 days after a donation is received.
For example, if you receive a donation on a Friday, the payment is issued on the following Saturday.
Fundraiser creators will need to attach a valid bank account to receive payments. Only bank accounts in eligible countries are supported to accept and receive fundraising payments.
Keep in mind that:
Once a payment is initiated, it may take your bank a few additional business days to deposit payments into your account.
If you haven't received money raised from your fundraiser after 8 days, please let us know .
