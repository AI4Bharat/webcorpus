Donations made on Facebook may be tax deductible. Review the information below to learn more whether a donation is tax-deductible.
Donations to Nonprofits
A donation to a nonprofit through its Facebook Page or a fundraiser on Facebook may be tax-deductible. Since tax laws vary by country and region, you should consult a tax professional or review the laws for your area to determine whether a donation is tax-deductible.
After you make a donation, a confirmation will be sent to the primary email listed on your Facebook account. This confirmation shows that you've made this donation as a charitable contribution and that you're not receiving any goods or services in return.

Donations to Fundraisers for Personal Causes
Donations made to personal fundraisers aren't normally tax deductible. If you have specific questions about the eligibility of a donation, please consult a tax professional.
Note: Donations and fundraiser features on Facebook aren't available in every area.
